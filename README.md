# CSS Short Hand editor

A Brackets extension for expanding shorthand css rules in the Quick Edit (CTRL + E).  
This extension is in a very initial state, every support is appreciated.

## Example

If you select a rule like the one below and press CTRL + E

    border: 1px solid black;
    

A Quick Edit panel will be opened, with the same rule expanded in the singular specific properties:

    border-width: 1px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
   
Here you will be able to edit the values of the properties and when you will close the Quick Edit, the rules will be condensed back to the short hand.
